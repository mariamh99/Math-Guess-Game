# Math-Guess-Game
A collection of games done with JavaFX via Eclipse IDE.
- The first game is "Guess The Number", the user should guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. If they give up, they can click on a button to reveal the correct answer. If the player reveals or correctly guesses the number, a pop-up window will appear to ask if they want to continue or quit the game.
- The second game is "Math Quiz Game", the player enters their username and select the correct answer for the equation ax = b, where a is a number between 0 and 10, and b is a multiple of a. The advanced version is where a is between the range of 11 & 100. The player can also change the font size and theme of the game.
